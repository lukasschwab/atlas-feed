# atlas-feed

This is a hacked-together JSON feed generator for [Atlas of Places](https://www.atlasofplaces.com); it na√Øvely processes their HTML, so I expect it to break eventually.

## Resources

+ [The feed is live here.](https://atlas-feed-dot-arxiv-feeds.appspot.com/)
+ [`arxiv-feeds`](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv-feeds) does similar work, but in a more general way.
